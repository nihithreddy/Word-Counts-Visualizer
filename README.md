Web App to Demonstrate [Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)

- Zipf's law  is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be  --    approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. Zipf distribution is related to the zeta distribution, but is  not identical.
